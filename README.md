# zodiac_sky_finder

A Flutter mobile application that helps users determine the position of astrological signs in the night sky based on the current month.  
The app uses **BLoC** for state management, a **service layer** for API calls, and a **fallback strategy** with a local mock API server.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Displays the zodiac sign for the current month.
- Highlights the userâ€™s own zodiac sign.
- Fetches the signâ€™s **universal position (RA/Dec)** via API.
- Falls back to local static data if API is unavailable.
- Deep links to **Sky-Map.org** to view the sign in the sky.
- Built with **BLoC** and **reusable components**.
- Styled with **Material 3 modern theming**.
